A few qualifiers make a personal loan easy to get. The most basic thing to look for are easy approval requirements.

Almost every lender checks an applicantâ€™s credit score as part of the decision process, but quick cash loan and bad credit loan providers generally have minimal credit history requirements. Some more common requirements for bad credit loan lenders include:

Age: You must be at least 18 years old.
Citizenship: You must be a US citizen or resident and have a valid Social Security number.
Income: You must meet a minimum income threshold, either through a regular paycheck, benefits, or another method.
Bank account: You must have an active bank or credit union account registered in your name.
Identification: You must provide a Social Security number, valid email address, bank account details, and work and/or home phone numbers.
